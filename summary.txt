CIVIL APPEAL NOs.8465-8466 OF 2024 
… RESPONDENTS 
1. The lead appeals call in question the judgment and order dated 20th 
June, 20241 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal 
Commission2 dismissing Execution Application Nos. 27/2023 and 
28/2023 filed by the appellant against the respondents 2 to 9 
(directors/promoters of M/s. Ansal Crown Infrabuild Pvt. Ltd.3). Such 
applications arose from two final orders rendered by the NCDRC while 
deciding complaints lodged by the appellant bearing nos. 
CC/2600/2018 and CC/86/2018 respectively.  
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
2. Appellant is an association of flat buyers which entered into Flat Buyer 
Agreements with ACIPL for units in Ansal Crown Heights. Vide 
1 impugned order 
2NCDRC 
3ACIPL 
2 
individual builder buyer agreements, ACIPL promised to handover 
possession of the apartments within a period of 36 months from the 
date of execution of the agreements, which expired for all the buyers 
in the time period from December, 2013 - December, 2015. Possession 
of the flats not having been delivered, the appellant instituted two 
consumer complaints – the first on 10th, January 2018 (on behalf of 
45 flat buyers), and the second on 26th November, 2018 (on behalf of 
20 flat buyers). The respondents were ACIPL and its 
directors/promoters being the respondents 2 to 9.  
3. While admitting CC/86/2018, the NCDRC vide order dated 25th 
January, 2018 directed that the proceedings would continue only 
against ACIPL and not the respondents 2 to 9. Accordingly, the 
appellant was directed to file amended memo of party impleading 
ACIPL as the sole respondent.   
4. Subsequently, CC/2600/2018 came to be lodged wherein ACIPL was 
arrayed as the sole respondent, in conformity with the earlier 
admission order.  
5. On 28th February, 2022, the complaints were allowed and directions 
were issued to ACIPL to complete the project; obtain the occupancy 
certificate; and hand over possession of the flats to the buyers, i.e., 
the allottees, with interest @ 9% per annum on the amounts deposited 
by them from the committed date of possession until the offer of 
possession or, alternatively, if the allottees were unwilling to wait for 
possession, ACIPL was directed to refund the entire amount deposited 
3 
with interest @ 9% per annum, to be paid within six weeks, failing 
which interest @ 12% per annum would apply for the period of default. 
6. Owing to ACIPL not complying with the said order, the appellant 
initiated proceedings for execution. During this time, corporate 
insolvency resolution process having been initiated under 
the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 20164 against ACPIL, a 
moratorium had come into force. NCDRC, accordingly, vide order dated 
18th May, 2023, adjourned proceedings sine die, including against the 
directors of ACPIL with the following observations: 
" ... So far opposite party Nos.2 to 9 are concerned, they were not 
party in the main complaint. If the decree cannot be executed against 
opposite party No.1 due to moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC, 
it would not be appropriate to proceed in same execution against 
opposite party Nos.2 to 9. In the light of order of National Company 
Law Tribunal, this Matter is adjourned sine die with liberty to the 
Parties to file an Application for listing of the Case in the event the 
National Company Law Tribunal alter, modify or vacates of the Order 
or decides the proceedings finally." 
7. Appellant then challenged the sine die adjournment granted by the 
NCDRC by filing Civil Appeal Nos. 4247, 4480 and 4481 of 2023 before 
this Court. The said appeals were allowed vide order dated 17th 
January 2024, whereby the abovementioned order of the NCDRC was 
set aside. This Court directed that the execution proceedings may 
continue against the respondents 2 to 9, while granting them liberty 
to raise all available objections, including the plea that they were not 
liable to satisfy or implement the order sought to be executed. This 
4IBC 
4 
Court held that the moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC shields 
only the corporate debtor and does not extend to directors/promoters.  
8. Upon revival, the appellant pressed the execution applications against 
the respondents 2 to 9. As noted, the NCDRC dismissed the execution 
applications insofar as they sought to proceed against the respondents 
2 to 9, holding that the order is executable only against ACIPL, the 
sole respondent in the original complaints. 
ISSUE 
9. The core controversy lies within a narrow compass. Question that 
arises is, can persons who were arrayed as respondents in the 
consumer complaints but ultimately against whom no notice was 
issued and the complaints did not proceed, could be brought within the 
net of execution, on the premise that they were directors/promoters 
of the judgment-debtor company. NCDRC has answered this question 
in the negative. We are called upon to decide whether such view 
warrants interference. 
ANALYSIS AND OBSERVATIONS 
10. It is not in dispute that at the stage of admitting CC/86/2018, the 
NCDRC consciously admitted the complaint on 25th January, 2018 only 
qua the respondent no. 1, namely ACIPL, while declining to issue 
notice to the directors and promoters. A specific direction was issued 
to amend the memo of parties accordingly, whereafter notice was 
issued only to ACIPL. The said order was never assailed and, therefore, 
attained finality. 
5 
11. Proceedings in the complaints thereafter continued on that basis 
alone. No pleadings were directed to be filed against, nor issues 
framed in relation to the directors or promoters, and no findings came 
to be recorded against them at any stage of the adjudicatory process. 
Once the lis stood consciously and finally confined to ACIPL, the 
adjudication culminated in an order binding exclusively ACIPL and 
none else. The order neither records any determination of liability 
against the respondents 2 to 9 nor contains any direction requiring 
them to perform or refrain from performing any act. In the absence of 
pleadings, adjudication, or findings against them, the essential 
foundation for fastening liability upon the respondents 2 to 9 is plainly 
lacking. 
12. Since, the judgment and order in CC/86/2018 and CC/2600/2018 had 
not been passed against the respondents 2 to 9, at the stage of 
execution, the order passed against ACIPL could not be enforced 
against them. It is settled law that execution must strictly conform to 
the decree. This principle has been reiterated in a catena of 
precedents. For the purpose of this discussion, we may profitably refer 
to Rajbir v. Suraj Bhan5 where this Court held that: 
“14. It is well settled that the executing court cannot go beyond the 
decree. The decree must be executed as it is. Though, it is indeed 
open to the executing court to construe the decree; it cannot go 
beyond the decree …” 
5(2022) 14 SCC 609 
6 
13. It is trite that a decree cannot, by process of execution, be employed 
to shift or enlarge liability so as to bind persons who were neither 
parties to the decree nor otherwise legally liable thereunder. Where 
the judgment debtor is a company, the liability of its shareholders or 
joint venture partners remains confined to the extent of their 
shareholding or to such guarantees or undertakings as may have been 
expressly furnished by them.  
14. In the present case, the appellant has neither pleaded nor established 
that the respondents 2 to 9 had furnished any guarantee or surety in 
respect of the investment made in the project, nor has any material 
been placed on record to attract the application of Section 14(3) of the 
IBC. 
15. Once a moratorium has been declared against the judgment debtor 
company, i.e., ACIPL, the modes of execution contemplated under 
Section 71 of the Consumer Protection Act, 20196 including 
attachment and sale of movable or immovable property, attachment 
of bank accounts, or withdrawal of decretal amounts from the accounts 
of the judgment debtor, stand interdicted. Execution proceedings 
cannot, therefore, be permitted to continue indirectly against the 
respondents 2 to 9, who are neither judgment debtors nor guarantors, 
and against whom no independent liability under the order allowing 
the complaints has been established. 
6CP Act 
7 
16. This Court in Electronics Corpn. of India Ltd. v. Secy., Revenue 
Deptt., Govt. of A.P.7 underscored that a clear distinction must be 
maintained between a company and its shareholders by observing as 
follows: 
“15. A clear distinction must be drawn between a company and its 
shareholder, even though that shareholder may be only one and that 
the Central or a State Government. In the eye of the law, a company 
registered under the Companies Act is a distinct legal entity other 
than the legal entity or entities that hold its shares.” 
17. We are in complete agreement with the approach adopted by the 
NCDRC that the CP Act envisages a complete adjudicatory process 
founded on service of notice, pleadings, opportunity to contest, leading 
of evidence, and recorded findings of fact and law. These are not mere 
procedural formalities but substantive safeguards that precede the 
fastening of liability. In the present case, no such adjudicatory exercise 
was undertaken qua the respondents 2 to 9. There are no pleadings 
attributing any personal role to them, no evidence led to establish 
individual culpability, and no findings returned fixing personal liability. 
In the absence of these foundational elements, execution proceedings 
cannot be utilised as a surrogate forum to impose liability where none 
has been adjudicated. 
18. It is apposite to note that the invocation of the doctrine of piercing the 
corporate veil is wholly unwarranted in the present factual matrix. The 
lifting of the corporate veil is an exceptional measure, to be resorted 
7(1999) 4 SCC 458 
8 
to only upon a clear finding that the corporate personality was abused 
for fraudulent or dishonest purposes. Such a finding must be preceded 
by specific pleadings and a determination on merits. No such allegation 
of fraud or misuse of the corporate form was either pleaded or 
established before the adjudicatory forum. In the absence of a prior 
and reasoned determination justifying disregard of the corporate 
personality, the directors/promoters cannot be exposed to personal 
liability through execution. 
19. Appellant placed reliance on the order of this Court dated 17th January, 
2024. The order reads as follows: 
“11. Therefore, we are of the view that only because there is a 
moratorium under Section 14 of the IBC against the company, it 
cannot be said that no proceedings can be initiated against the 
opposite party Nos. 2 to 9(the respondent Nos. 2 .to 9) for execution, 
provided that they ·are otherwise liable to abide by and comply with 
the order, which is passed against the company. The protection of 
the moratorium will not be available to the directors/officers of the 
company. 
12. Therefore, we set aside the impugned judgments and orders and 
remit the execution application to the National Commission. The 
execution will continue against the opposite party Nos. 2 to 9(the 
respondent Nos. 2 to 9) in the execution application. 
13. It is open for the opposite party Nos. 2 to 9 (the respondent Nos. 
2 to 9) to raise a contention that they are not bound to implement 
the order sought to be executed. They are entitled to file additional 
objections along with documents raising the issue of executability as 
against them. 
14. We clarify that the issue whether opposite party Nos. 2 to 9 (the 
respondent Nos. 2 to 9) to the execution are otherwise liable, will 
have to be decided by the National Commission in accordance with 
law." 
(emphasis ours) 
20. A plain reading of the said order shows that it addressed a limited 
issue, namely, whether the existence of a moratorium under Section 
9 
14 of the IBC, against ACIPL, operated as a bar to the continuation of 
execution proceedings against its directors/promoters. This Court held 
that the moratorium, by itself, does not preclude execution 
proceedings against directors or officers, provided they are otherwise 
liable. 
21. Importantly, the order did not determine or declare any personal 
liability of the respondents 2 to 9. On the contrary, this Court expressly 
left it open to them to raise all objections as to executability and 
clarified that the question whether they are otherwise liable to comply 
with the order was required to be decided by the NCDRC in accordance 
with law. The order dated 17th January, 2024, therefore, merely 
removed the moratorium-related impediment and did not expand the 
scope of the order or fasten liability upon the directors. 
22. Viewed in this light, the impugned order of the NCDRC, which 
examines the issue of executability against the respondents 2 to 9 on 
its own merits and declines to proceed against them in the absence of 
any legal or factual basis for personal liability, cannot be said to be 
inconsistent with the order of this Court.  
23. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and having perused the 
record, we are of the considered view that the NCDRC committed no 
error of law or jurisdiction in declining to execute the order against 
persons who were admittedly not parties to the complaints. The order 
binds only ACIPL. Appellant did not challenge the order dated 25th 
January, 2018 of the NCDRC declining to issue notice to the 
10 
respondents 2 to 9 and directing it to file amended memo of party with 
ACIPL as the sole respondent, and cannot now enlarge the order 
through execution. Hence, in our opinion, the appeals must fail. 
24. Consequently, the appeals are dismissed. 
25. However, this dismissal will not preclude the appellant from pursuing 
any remedy available in law against the promoters/directors, including 
proceedings under the Companies Act, IBC, or civil law, should the 
statutory requirements therefor be satisfied. 
26. There shall be no order as to costs. 
CIVIL APPEAL NOs.8539, 10874-10877 & 10878 OF 2024  
27. These appeals involve similar questions of fact and law as raised in the 
lead appeals and for the reasons aforementioned, the same too stand 
dismissed.
