SUPREME COURT JUDGMENT SUMMARY
======================================================================

Case: Civil Appeal No. 8539 of 2024
Court: Supreme Court of India
Date: January 12, 2026
Bench: Dipankar Datta, Augustine George Masih

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The lead appeals call in question the judgment and order dated 20th June, 20241 of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission2 dismissing Execution Application Nos.

LEGAL ISSUE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
can persons who were arrayed as respondents in the consumer complaints but ultimately against whom no notice was issued and the complaints did not proceed, could be brought within the net of execution, on the premise that they were directors/promoters of the judgment-debtor company.

KEY HOLDINGS & LEGAL REASONING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Once the lis stood consciously and finally confined to ACIPL, the adjudication culminated in an order binding exclusively ACIPL and none else.

2. The order neither records any determination of liability against
  . the respondents to nor contains any direction requiring them to
  . perform or refrain from performing any act. In the absence of
  . pleadings, adjudication, or findings against them, the essential
  . foundation for fastening liability upon the respondents to is
  . plainly lacking.
3. It is trite that a decree cannot, by process of execution, be employed to shift or enlarge liability so as to bind persons who were neither parties to the decree nor otherwise legally liable thereunder.

4. the CP Act envisages a complete adjudicatory process founded on service of notice, pleadings, opportunity to contest, leading of evidence, and recorded findings of fact and law. These are not mere procedural formalities but substantive safeguards that precede the fastening of liability.

FINAL ORDER
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Consequently, the appeals are dismissed. However, this dismissal will not preclude the appellant from pursuing any remedy available in law against the promoters/directors, including proceedings under the Companies Act, IBC, or civil law, should the statutory requirements therefor be satisfied.
